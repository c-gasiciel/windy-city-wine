      <h3>Sakura Dream</h3>
      <p class="item-description">
        The finest Japanese cherry blossoms preserved fresh from Kyoto. An
        exotic, floral cherry infusion rarely seen outside of Japan.
      </p>

      <h3>Fresh Green Kukicha</h3>
      <p class="item-description">
        Fresh from the Shizuoka Prefecture in Japan, this low-caffeine, rare
        green tea is made from the stem and stalks of the Gyokuro tea tree.
        Shaded five weeks before final picking to naturally force chlorophyll
        to the plant,this is a true macrobiotic Japanese green tea.
      </p>

      <h3>Emperor’s Genmaicha</h3>
      <p class="item-description">
          A blend of sencha and roasted and popped rice with a nutty, full
          bodied, toasted green tea flavor. Genmaicha has medium to high
          caffeine and is high in chlorophylls.
      </p>

      <h3>Emperor’s Golden Hojicha</h3>
      <p class="item-description">
          This Golden Hojicha is high-grade Japanese green tea that has been
          roasted, resulting in a tea with an enticing, deep smoky aroma and
          round flavor.
      </p>

      <h3>Emperor’s Sakura Cherry Noir</h3>
      <p class="item-description">
          Dried and pickled pink Sakura flower petals are gently blended with
          our professionally selected fine black tea. The subtle sweetness of
          the Sakura harmonizes with the tea to create an aromatic infusion that
          is a perfect celebration of cherry blossom season.
      </p>

      <h3>Emperor’s Gyokuro</h3>
      <p class="item-description">
          Incredible Japanese green known as “jade dew.” This tea is the finest
          non-ceremonial tea produced in Japan. This tea is grown where the
          first Japanese tea was planted in the Uji District of Honshu near
          Kyoto. Picked from old bushes that are shaded to reduce the effects of
          photosynthesis, everything connected with the tending of this tea is
          done by hand. A bright and lovely cup with medium caffeine, and
          high antioxidants and chlorophylls.
