    <div class="panel whitePanel">
      <p>Loire Valley, France</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Established in 1749 in the heart of Sancerre, Domaine Fouassier is
          one of the oldest wine growing families in the Loire Valley with a
          history that spans ten generations.</li>
        <li>In 2011 the current owners, Benoit and Paul Fouassier, converted
            estate to biodynamic farming and winemaking.</li>

    <p class="accordion accWhite">2017 Patrick Piuze Bourgogne Aligoté <em>1953</em></p>
    <div class="panel whitePanel">
      <p>Burgundy, France</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aligoté pronounced “al-uh-GO-tay”, is the only other white grape
          allowed to be grown in Burgundy besides Chardonnay.  It is a natural
          cross between Pinot Noir and the seldom-seen Gouais blanc.</li>
        <li>In most areas of Burgundy, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were considered
           better wine grapes, and thus could demand higher prices. In some
           regions, Aligoté was banned.</li>
        <li>This is made by Patrick Piuze, a famous winemaker based in Chablis
          who has used his connections to source grapes from some of the best
          plots in the area to make his wines. </li>
      </ul>
